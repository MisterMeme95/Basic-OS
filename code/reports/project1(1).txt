Project 1 Report

Exercise 1: After modifying the SimpleThread() function and running it while supplying different parameters the ThreadTest() function, every single thread saw a final value of 5. This is because, in the modified SimpleThread() function, the for loop goes five times for each thread, so each thread will always see a final value of whatever value is given in the for loop.
